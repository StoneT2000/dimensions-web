# Dimensions Web

This is the website for viewing AI Competition data produced by the [Dimensions](https://github.com/StoneT2000/Dimensions) AI Competition framework.

Install this using

```
npm install @dimensions-ai/web
```

Run the website using

To start viewing things, make sure you are running the Station from the Dimensions framework. This can be done by making sure you didn't give the configuration of `activateStation: false` when creating your Dimension.
